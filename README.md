Req&Res Framework (pronounced Ree-Qwyaen-Dres)
====================

This is a piece of a crap, coded by me in about 4 (+a hour of debugging extra)(and another hour for commenting) which enables you to build a website.

Framework! Ah! It's a nice name that can be given to it!


Why use this?
-------------

**Simple Answer** : Don't use this! Really! 

There are lot of good framework to understand and use. You can stick to them. They are cool.

But if you want to know how things are in the beginning, you can use this. I've commented almost everything so that it'll be easier to learn (about routing and request response things)


Hey, Wait! You can extend this!
-----------------

You can extend this to make just another cool framework. But be sure to include my name somewhere, huh? 

And I don't need donations. Feeding me would suffice ;)
